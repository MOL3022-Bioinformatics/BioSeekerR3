    "What are proteins?": 
      "Proteins are molecules that perform essential tasks in the body, like digestion, muscle movement, and fighting diseases. They are made of amino acids linked together in a chain. \n\n🔍 Try asking: 'What is the function of this protein?'",
  
    "What are amino acids?": 
      "Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 different types, and their arrangement affects a protein’s function. \n\n🔍 Try asking: 'What are essential about the protein’s amino acids?'",
  
    "Why do proteins fold?": 
      "Proteins fold into specific 3D shapes to function properly. If they fold incorrectly, they may not work and could lead to diseases. \n\n🔍 Try asking: 'What happens if this protein misfolds?'",
  
    "What do protein colors mean?": 
      "Different colors in protein visualization highlight different features. Colors can indicate specific amino acids, structural regions, or functional sites. \n\n🔍 Try asking: 'What does the red part of this protein mean?'",
  
    "What do the different shapes mean?": 
      "Proteins have structural features like coils (alpha helices) and flat arrows (beta sheets). These help determine their function. \n\n🔍 Try asking: 'Does this protein contain beta sheets?'",

    "What is an active site?": 
      "The active site is the part of a protein (usually an enzyme) where it binds to other molecules to trigger a reaction. It’s like a key fitting into a lock. \n\n🔍 Try asking: 'Where is the active site of this protein?'",
  
    "Why are some parts of a protein hidden inside?": 
      "Some amino acids avoid water (hydrophobic) and stay inside the protein to stabilize it. Others are on the surface to interact with water. \n\n🔍 Try asking: 'Where are the hydrophobic regions in this protein?'",
  
    "How can mutations affect proteins?": 
      "A mutation is a change in the protein’s structure. Some mutations do nothing, but others can stop a protein from working, leading to diseases like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia. \n\n🔍 Try asking: 'What happens if there is a mutation in this protein?'"
